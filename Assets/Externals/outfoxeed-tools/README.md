## ðŸŸ  TOOLS

### ðŸŸ¡ Data Editor Window
Editor Window able to query all ScriptableObjects of given types in the project to edit game's data more easily.
It is also able to delete and add ScriptableObjects of the same given types.

The types of ScriptableObjects to show and the path where to create new instances are easily editable in another EditorWindow openable from the 'Config' button in the DataEditorWindow.

### ðŸŸ¡ Toolbar Buttons
Thanks to [Unity Toolbar Extender](https://github.com/marijnz/unity-toolbar-extender), we can easily add labels and buttons in the Unity toolbar. 
This package adds automatically one button for each scene in the build settings so you can switch of scene easily. 

### ðŸŸ¡ SerializeReference ContextualMenu
Using SerializeReference fields we can Serialize in the Inspector an abstract class.
But we need more stuff to just create an instance of a concrete class and assign it to the property.

This package contains the ability to recognize SerializeReference fields and to give you the power to 
set the concrete type of the field instance by right clicking on it
